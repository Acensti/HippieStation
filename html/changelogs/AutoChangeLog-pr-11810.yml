  - balance: "No-Slips are now 3 TC brown shoes that cannot be chameleoned."
  - balance: "Thermal Imaging Goggles also cannot be chameleoned, and look like regular mesons at first."
  - tweak: "Thermal Imaging Goggles are now considered a stealthy tool rather than a device (they'll be found in stealthy tools, not devices and tools)"
