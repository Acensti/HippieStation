changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added a bunch of stuff back to the botany vending machine from pre-rebase (e.g. saltpetre, diethylamine)"
  - rscadd: "Added recipes from pre-rebase back to the biogenerator (e.g. unstable mutagen and the other botany chemicals, jackets, bats, belts)
balance: Plant DNA manipulator production speed limitation starts at 7 instead of 9 now"
  - bugfix: "Gold gaia overlay on botany trays is no longer overwritten by the plant overlay"
  - bugfix: "Pills and produce now transfer all their reagents to hydroponics trays before deleting. Trays now truly only require 20u of earthsblood to become self-sustaining (before it was over two times that by accident)"
