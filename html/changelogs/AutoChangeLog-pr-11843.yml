  - bugfix: "you know at first I thought I was being smug but then I realized the code didn't work at all, so the joke is on me. sleeping will now actually heal you again, assuming you aren't in deepcrit"
  - bugfix: "meaning that you should be fine if you're in softcrit, you can still sleep there"
