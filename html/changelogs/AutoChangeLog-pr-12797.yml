changes:
  - rscadd: 5 new recipes for the curator's various obelisks (most of them were already
      created, I just forgot to add them to the obelisk code)
  - rscadd: The curator's obelisks can now be used once per obelisk to create 1 use
      books that teach everything of the respective tier. This means other people
      can learn how to make the obelisks now (without buying another book from the
      Spacestar Ordering Book Catalog).
  - balance: CODEWORD Arabian now only has a 50% chance of dropping an improvised
      glock.
  - balance: Nerfed the health of the curator's obelisks.
  - bugfix: Fixed the d100 recipe spawning a d00 die.
  - soundadd: The obelisks now have sound effects.
  - imageadd: Added icons for the books. They were sprited by Crunion and Punkinguy.
  - spellcheck: Fixed a typo with CODEWORD Arabian's description.
