  - balance: "Sleeping Carp"
  - tweak: "Sleeping Carp is now a 5 TC mask. The mask is easily concealable, and gives you the martial art. But it has no block chance. If you want the block chance back, put two masks together to make a suit. Gun restriction has been removed from the mask version, but the block chance and gun restriction are kept on the suit. You cannot take the suit off once it's on."
