  Skylar Lineman, your local R&D; moonlighter:
  - rscadd: Research has been completely overhauled into the techweb system! No more
      levels, the station now unlocks research "nodes" with research points passively
      generated when there is atleast one research server properly cooled, powered,
      and online.
  - rscadd: R&amp;D; lab has been replaced by the departmental lathe system on the
      three major maps. Each department gets a lathe and possibly a circuit imprinter
      that only have designs assigned by that department.
  - rscadd: The ore redemption machine has been moved into cargo bay on maps with
      decentralized research to prevent the hallways from becoming a free for all.
      Honk!
  - balance: You shouldn't expect balance as this is the initial merge. Please put
      all feedback and concerns on the forum so we can revise the system over the
      days, weeks, and months, to make this enjoyable for everyone. Heavily wanted
      are ideas of how to add more ways of generating points.
  - balance: You can get techweb points by setting off bombs with an active science
      doppler array listening. The bombs have to have a theoretical radius far above
      maxcap to make a difference. You can only go up, not down, in radius, so you
      can't get 6 times the points with 6 TTVs. The algorithm is exponentially/logarithmically
      scaled to prevent "world destroyer" bombs from instantly finishing research.
  SpaceManiac:
  - bugfix: The detective and heads of staff are no longer attacked by portable turrets.
  Swindly:
  - rscadd: You can kill yourself with a few more items.
  WJohnston:

      maps. Use the docking navigator computer instead! This gives the white ship
      and syndicate infiltrator more room to navigate and place custom locations that
      are otherwise occupied by fixed shuttle landing zones that are rarely used.
  XDTM:
  - rscadd: 'Added two new symptoms: one allows viruses to still work while dead,
      and allows infection of undead species, and one allows infection of inorganic
      species (such as plasmapeople or golems).'
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: Deep fryers now have sound.
  - tweak: Deep fryers now use cooking oil, a specialized reagent that becomes highly
      damaging at high temperatures. You can get it from grinding soybeans and meat.
  - tweak: Deep fryers now become more efficient with higher-level micro lasers, using
      less oil and frying faster.
  - tweak: Deep fryers now slowly use oil as it fries objects, instead of all at once.
  - bugfix: You can now correctly refill deep fryers with syringes and pills.
