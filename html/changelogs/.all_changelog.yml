2017-11-13:
  Cobby:
  - rscadd: The Xray now only hits the first mob it comes into contact with instead
      of being outright removed from the game.
  Floyd / Qustinnus:
  - soundadd: Reebe now has ambience sounds

  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: Welders must now be screwdrivered open to reveal their fuel tank.
  - rscadd: You can empty welders into open containers (like beakers or glasses) when
      they're screwdrivered open.
  - rscadd: You can now insert any chemical into a welder, but all most will do is
      clog the fuel. Welding fuel will refuel it as usual. Plasma in welders tends
      to explode.
  Qbopper and JJRcop:
  - tweak: The default internet sound volume was changed from 100 to 25. Stop complaining
      in OOC about your ears!

  - bugfix: Posters may no longer be placed on diagonal wall corners.
  WJohnston:
  - rscdel: Removes stationary docking ports for syndicate infiltrator ships on all
      maps. Use the docking navigator computer instead! This gives the white ship
      and syndicate infiltrator more room to navigate and place custom locations that
      are otherwise occupied by fixed shuttle landing zones that are rarely used.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: Deep fryers now have sound.
  - tweak: Deep fryers now use cooking oil, a specialized reagent that becomes highly

  ninjanomnom:
  - rscadd: You can now select a nearby area to expand when using a blueprint instead
      of making a new area.
  - rscadd: New shuttle areas can be created using blueprints. This is currently not
      useful but will be used later for shuttle construction.
  - tweak: Blueprints can modify existing areas on station.
  - admin: Blueprint functionality has been added to the debug tab as a verb.
2017-11-14:
  ike709:
  - imageadd: Added directional computer sprites. Maps haven't been changed yet.
  psykzz:
  - refactor: AI Airlock UI to use TGUI
  - tweak: Allow AI to swap between electrified door states without having to un-electrify
      first.

      that an additional cultist will spawn.
  - tweak: On average you will see less roundstart cultists in lowpop and more roundstart
      cultists in highpop.
  - tweak: Damage examinations now include a "moderate" classification. Before minor
      was <30 and severe was anything 30 or above. Now minor is <25, moderate is 25
      to <50, and severe is 50+.
  - tweak: The tesla will now move toward power beacons at a significantly slower
      rate.

      it, preventing AI blobbernauts from running off the blob and to their deaths.
  - rscdel: Following complaints that cargo has been selling all the materials they

  Skylar Lineman, your local R&D moonlighter:
  - rscadd: Research has been completely overhauled into the techweb system! No more
      levels, the station now unlocks research "nodes" with research points passively
      generated when there is atleast one research server properly cooled, powered,
      and online.
  - rscadd: R&D lab has been replaced by the departmental lathe system on the three
      major maps. Each department gets a lathe and possibly a circuit imprinter that
      only have designs assigned by that department.
  - rscadd: The ore redemption machine has been moved into cargo bay on maps with
      decentralized research to prevent the hallways from becoming a free for all.
      Honk!
  - balance: You shouldn't expect balance as this is the initial merge. Please put
      all feedback and concerns on the forum so we can revise the system over the
      days, weeks, and months, to make this enjoyable for everyone. Heavily wanted
      are ideas of how to add more ways of generating points.
  - balance: You can get techweb points by setting off bombs with an active science
      doppler array listening. The bombs have to have a theoretical radius far above
      maxcap to make a difference. You can only go up, not down, in radius, so you
      can't get 6 times the points with 6 TTVs. The algorithm is exponentially/logarithmically
      scaled to prevent "world destroyer" bombs from instantly finishing research.
  SpaceManiac:
  - bugfix: HUDs from mechs and helmets no longer conflict with HUD glasses and no
      longer inappropriately remove implanted HUDs.
  - code_imp: Chasm code has been refactored to be more sane.
  - bugfix: Building lattices over chasms no longer sometimes deletes the chasm.
  - code_imp: Ladders have been refactored and should be far less buggy.
  - bugfix: Jacob's ladder actually works again.
  - bugfix: Pizza box stacking works again.
  - bugfix: Fix some permanent-on and permanent-off bugs caused by the HUD stacking
      change.

      airlocks.

      balancing in symptoms.
  - rscadd: Starlight Condensation heals toxin damage if you're in space using starlight
      as a catalyst. Being up to two tiles away also works, as long as you can still
      see it, but slower.
  - rscadd: Toxolysis (level 7) rapidly cleanses all chemicals from the body, with
      no exception.
  - rscadd: 'Cellular Molding heals brute damage depending on your body temperature:
      the higher the temperature, the faster the healing. Requires above-average temperature
      to activate, and the speed heavily increases while on fire.'
  - rscadd: Regenerative Coma (level 8) causes the virus to send you into a deep coma
      when you are heavily damaged (>70 brute+burn damage). While you are unconscious,
      either from the virus or from other sources, the virus will heal both brute
      and burn damage fairly quickly. Sleeping also works, but at reduced speed.
  - rscadd: Tissue Hydration heals burn damage if you are wet (negative fire stacks)
      or if you have water in your bloodstream.
  - rscadd: Plasma Fixation (level 8) stabilizes temperature and heals burns while
      plasma is in your body or while standing in a plasma cloud. Does not protect
      from the poisoning effects of plasma.
  - rscadd: Radioactive Resonance gives a mild constant brute and burn healing while
      irradiated. The healing becomes more intense if you reach higher levels of radiation,
      but is still less than the alternatives.
  - rscadd: Metabolic Boost (level 7) doubles the rate at which you process chemicals,
      good and bad, but also increases hunger tenfold.
  kevinz000:
  - bugfix: Cryo cells can now be properly rotated with a wrench.
  ninjanomnom:
  - rscadd: 'You can now make a new tasty traditional treat: butterdogs. Watch out,
      they''re slippery.'

      of being outright removed from the game.

  - rscadd: You can empty welders into open containers (like beakers or glasses) when
      they're screwdrivered open.
  - rscadd: You can now insert any chemical into a welder, but all most will do is
      clog the fuel. Welding fuel will refuel it as usual. Plasma in welders tends
      to explode.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: Deep fryers now have sound.
  - tweak: Deep fryers now use cooking oil, a specialized reagent that becomes highly
      damaging at high temperatures. You can get it from grinding soybeans and meat.
  - tweak: Deep fryers now become more efficient with higher-level micro lasers, using
      less oil and frying faster.
  - tweak: Deep fryers now slowly use oil as it fries objects, instead of all at once.
  - bugfix: You can now correctly refill deep fryers with syringes and pills.
  ninjanomnom:
  - rscadd: You can now select a nearby area to expand when using a blueprint instead
      of making a new area.
  - rscadd: New shuttle areas can be created using blueprints. This is currently not
      useful but will be used later for shuttle construction.
  - tweak: Blueprints can modify existing areas on station.
  - admin: Blueprint functionality has been added to the debug tab as a verb.
