  - tweak: "Rearranged the bar behind the counter- and to some degree in the backroom- to be less awful and promote robust bartending. Some examples are: Moved around the dispensers and vendor so you can access them all from the same tile, put the shaker in front of you when you spawn and added a chemtank to the working area for storing/vending mixed drinks easily (with a screwdriver in the materials closet)."
